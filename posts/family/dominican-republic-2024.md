## Story

We went on a 10 day trip to the caribbean. Starting with a trip to the Dominican Republic! Our original plan was to fly into Santo Domingo where we booked an Airbnb for November 28th(Thursday) - December 1st(Sunday). There's an overnight ferry from Santo Domingo to San Jose that we were going to take the 1st and spend six days in Puerto Rico. But we didn't book the ferry in time and it ended up selling out. After a bit of a panic we ended up getting a flight from the DR to the west side of PR, on a local Dominican airline, for the afternoon of the 2nd. This ended up saving us a 2 hour drive across the island. Our plan in PR was to spend most of our time in Aquadilla before making a bit of a winding trip back to San Juan to see a baseball game and the city for a couple nights before flying back to Chicago.

We had a 6AM flight out on Thanksgiving morning with a 1.5 hour layover in Atlanta before continuing on to Santo Domingo. I was extremely nervous to be flying into one of the countries busiest airports on what could have been the busiest travel day of the year and trying to make a connecting flight with two young kids, one of which would almost certainly need to go to the bathroom and both would be in varying states of sleepiness. 

Our travel to Santo Domingo could not have gone better. Atlanta airport was probably as empty as it could have been and we had more than enough time to deplane, go to the bathroom, get a snack, get to our next gate, get another snack and go to the bathroom again. Hoping our luck continues on future flights. ðŸ¤ž

The kids continued their great travelers streak propped up by more toys than I know how they fit in our carryons and two parents that are very fearful of crying kids on planes.

We successfully got through the airport and found a taxi driver to take us to our AirBNB in the heart of the Zona Colonial, a main tourist destination in Santo Domingo. There was a lot of construction and after a couple circles our taxi driver couldn't drive down the street but we were able to check in and get our luggage down the street into the AirBNB.

I(Nick) was having some ear issues after the flight and went to find a pharmacy. The closest one was right off the main tourist square area called Parque Colon. Upon arriving I thought it was so cool I immediately went back to get Rachel and the kids because I wanted them to see it. It was a little late given how early everyone was up but the kids had fun at a local pizza place and seeing all the lights.
