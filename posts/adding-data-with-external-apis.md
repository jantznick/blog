## Background

This is going to be a pretty short post, but one that I think will come in handy for a lot of people. A lot of times when getting data from 3rd parties they don't always include data you may want to analyze. Or maybe you're doing an analysis and just wanted to poke a little deeper. That is what happened to me and I wanted to share about it. 

I was recently downloading some data sets from the [NYC data portal](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) and wanted to go a little bit deeper into analyzing the types of taxis in NYC.
