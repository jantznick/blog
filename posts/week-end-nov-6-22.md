## Triathlon Training Week of October 31st - November 6th 2022

Tough week. Still recovering from the difficulties of my 20 minute FTP test as well as adding in running did not give my legs much time to recover for workouts.

Starting next week going into a run block until the F3 half marathon at the end of January. I will begin by just adding mileage until I am regularly around 30-40 miles per week without a huge effort. At that point I will begin to slowly add tempo runs and track workouts as they fit. 

Following this week I have decided to ease up my expectations and shoot for more focused session with the following schedule:
Monday: Run
Tuesday: Bike
Wednesday: Run
Thursday: Bike
Friday: Run
Saturday: Run & Bike
Sunday: Run & Bike

This will lower my stress of trying to get 2 workouts in, but cut back on my rest days. Hoping that the runs on Monday, Wednesday or Friday can be considered rest.
