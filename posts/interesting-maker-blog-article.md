I recently came across this post about taking over a dead IOT company that really intrigued me.

https://blog.kchung.co/taking-over-a-dead-iot-company/

The first reason I got into Development was through wanting to learn how to code after picking up a raspberry pi and a simple LED matrix from Alibaba. I had recently stumbled across the CTA open API and wanted to make essentially the exact same thing that this company tried to do. I even remember seeing this product on Facebook and Instagram ads and thinking, should I just buy this product instead of doing it myself.

I even at one point had a dream of making a similar product and selling it, almost identically to using a raspberry pi in the frame to control an led matrix.

I mainly wanted to share because I think the author takes an honest look at what happened not just from a tech perspective but also from a business perspective. It can be tough work running a product company that has to provide ongoing support and an API to devices in the world long after they're sold. For every company like this that actually ended up getting started and selling physical products, there's definitely about 100 entrepreneurs that had an idea but didn't take it all the way to sales because they couldn't figure out how to continue providing the service expected long after the physical product is in the customers hands.
