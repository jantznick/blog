## Background

Entalpi, the company that works with Gustav Iden and Kristian Blummenfelt recently released some raw data from the run at Kona 2022.

I am going to be taking a basic look at some of the data released in a series of Jupyter Notebooks as a way of further my skills.

Data and more info can be found on their Github here:

## Continuation

In this notebook we're looking at calculating gradient between various points on the run and seeing how that affects an athletes pace.
