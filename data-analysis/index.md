I have always had a deep interest in numbers and statistics. It wasn't until I took a marketing research class in college and learned about [Target's use of big data and analytics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RC5HNTj3Dag) that I really started to see the full potential of what could be done with numbers.

Taken a little bit further, the application of AI and ML is something that I enjoy studying and learning about. I am also heavily interested in computer vision and what can be applied with some AI and ML.

I have also built my own [Nvidia Jetbot](https://jetbot.org/master/) as a way to help practice basic skills as well.
